# Broadlink Binding

The binding integrates devices based on Broadlink controllers.
As the binding uses the [broadlink-java-api](https://github.com/mob41/broadlink-java-api), theoretically all devices supported by the api can be integrated with this binding.

*Note:* So far only the Floureon Thermostat has been tested! 

## Supported Things

*Note:* So far only the Floureon Thermostat has been tested! The other things are "best guess" implementations.

| Things                  | Description                                                   | Thing Type           |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Floureon Thermostat     | Broadlink based Thermostat sold with the branding Floureon    | floureonthermostat   |
| Hysen Thermostat        | Broadlink based Thermostat sold with the branding Hysen       | hysenthermostat      |
| A1 Environmental Sensor | Broadlink based A1 Environmental Sensor                       | a1environmentalsensor|

## Discovery

Broadlink devices are discovered on the network by sending a specific broadcast message.
Authentication is automatically sent after creating the thing.

## Thing Configuration

Two parameter are required for creating things:
- `host`: The hostname or IP address of the device.
- `mac` : The network MAC of the device.
The autodiscovery process finds both parts automatically.
